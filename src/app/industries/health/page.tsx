          <h2>Healthcare AI Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            Our healthcare AI solutions are designed with patient safety, clinical efficacy, 
            and regulatory compliance as core principles. We work closely with healthcare 
            providers to understand clinical workflows and integrate AI seamlessly into 
            existing systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Clinical Decision Support</h3>
          <p>
            Our AI systems provide evidence-based recommendations to support clinical 
            decision-making. These systems analyze patient data, medical literature, 
            and clinical guidelines to assist healthcare providers with diagnosis, 
            treatment planning, and care optimization.
          </p>

          <h3>Medical Imaging & Diagnostics</h3>
          <p>
            Advanced computer vision and machine learning models analyze medical images 
            including X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and pathology slides. Our systems can 
            detect abnormalities, quantify disease progression, and assist with 
            diagnostic accuracy.
          </p>

          <h3>Drug Discovery & Development</h3>
          <p>
            AI-accelerated drug discovery platforms that analyze molecular structures, 
            predict drug interactions, and optimize clinical trial design. Our systems 
            help pharmaceutical companies reduce development timelines and improve 
            success rates.
