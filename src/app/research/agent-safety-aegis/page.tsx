          <h2>Research Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Agent Safety Aegis is our comprehensive research initiative focused on developing 
            robust safety frameworks for autonomous AI agents. As AI agents become more capable 
            and autonomous, ensuring their safe operation becomes critical for deployment in 
            real-world environments.

          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <p>
            We develop multi-layered safety architectures that combine proactive safety measures 
            with reactive monitoring and intervention capabilities. Our approach integrates 
            formal verification methods with practical deployment considerations.

          <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
          <p>
            Our agent safety framework combines multiple complementary approaches to ensure 
            comprehensive protection against various failure modes and safety risks.
          </p>

          <h3>Formal Verification</h3>
          <p>
            We use formal methods to verify that agent behaviors satisfy safety properties 
            under all possible scenarios. This includes model checking, theorem proving, 
            and temporal logic specifications.
          </p>

          <h3>Runtime Monitoring</h3>
          <p>
            Real-time monitoring systems track agent behaviors and environment states to 
            detect potential safety violations before they occur. Our monitors use machine 
            learning and rule-based approaches.
          </p>

          <h3>Safe Reinforcement Learning</h3>
          <p>
            We develop reinforcement learning algorithms that incorporate safety constraints 
            directly into the learning process, ensuring that agents learn safe behaviors 
            from the beginning.
          </p>

          <h2>Current Research Status</h2>
          <p>
            Our research has produced several key innovations in agent safety, including 
            novel safety verification techniques, real-time monitoring frameworks, and 
            human-AI collaboration protocols. Several components are already deployed in 
            production systems.
