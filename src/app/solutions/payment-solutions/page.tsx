          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Our payment solutions combine advanced AI algorithms with robust infrastructure 
            to provide secure, efficient, and intelligent payment processing. The system 
            analyzes transaction patterns in real-time to detect fraud, assess risk, and 
            optimize payment routing.
          </p>

          <h3>Real-time Fraud Detection</h3>
          <p>
            Our AI models analyze hundreds of transaction signals in real-time to identify 
            fraudulent activities. The system continuously learns from new fraud patterns 
            and adapts to emerging threats, maintaining high accuracy while minimizing 
            false positives.
          </p>

          <h3>Intelligent Risk Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            Advanced risk scoring algorithms evaluate transaction risk based on multiple 
            factors including user behavior, device fingerprinting, and transaction context. 
            This enables dynamic risk-based authentication and decision making.
          </p>

          <h3>Optimized Payment Processing</h3>
          <p>
            Smart routing algorithms optimize payment processing by selecting the best 
            payment paths based on success rates, costs, and performance metrics. The 
            system automatically handles failover and retry logic for maximum reliability.

          <h2>Security & Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            Our payment solutions are built with security-first principles and comply with 
            the highest industry standards including PCI DSS, SOX, and regional data 
            protection regulations.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Protection</h3>
          <p>
            All sensitive payment data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard 
            encryption algorithms. Tokenization ensures that sensitive data never persists 
            in our systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            Automated compliance monitoring ensures adherence to global payment regulations 
            including PCI DSS, AML, KYC, and regional requirements. Regular compliance 
            reports and audits are automatically generated.
          </p>

          <h3>Fraud Prevention</h3>
          <p>
            Multi-layered fraud prevention combines machine learning models, rule-based 
            systems, and behavioral analysis to provide comprehensive protection against 
            various types of payment fraud.
