We build internal developer platforms (IDPs) that encode best practices as paved roads-with golden templates, shared runtime services, and guardrails for security, cost, and reliability. Teams ship faster because the platform removes undifferentiated heavy lifting and provides measurable DevEx improvements.", "Our approach is product-led: we treat the platform as a multi-tenant product with customers (feature teams), SLAs/SLOs, a backlog, and adoption goals. We define high-leverage capabilities once (identity, policy-as-code, CI/CD, IaC, observability, FinOps) and expose them as APIs and self-service experiences. Everything is instrumented-time to first commit, time to first deploy, lead time for change, change failure rate, mean time to restore, on-call load, and per-team/cloud cost envelopes. Success is when teams create value quickly without needing a platform concierge.", "Technically, the platform standardizes: (1) developer workstations and templates; (2) build pipelines and artifact standards; (3) environment vending via IaC; (4) runtime policy and service mesh; (5) tracing/metrics/logs with out-of-the-box dashboards; (6) security controls from commit to production; and (7) cost/SLO governance with automated feedback. We prefer composable, open interfaces over monoliths; we adopt where it's good enough and build where differentiation matters."]
